When does all of this end <br>
When do sweet devils rise<br>
come forth and serenade me<br>
as I fall into perdition<br>
When does heaven scream and screech<br>
When does hell laugh then frown<br>
watching me<br>
as I bleed on a mighty hill<br>
of jasmine and poppies<br>
<br>
When do sins forgive their hold<br>
and let my wounds swiftly heal<br>
new and old<br>
When do Gods of ancient lore<br>
extend their hands<br>
and mend my heart <br>
from the tumoil which I have sought<br>
<br>
